# Udacity Neighborhood Map Project
This web application is to show the use of the [Knockout framework](http://knockoutjs.com/) with the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) and [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/). This project was made for Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree.

1. CSS directory - .css styles
2. JS directory - app.js, bootstrap.min.js, jquery-3.3.1.js, knockout-3.4.2.js, locations.js javascript files
3. index.html

## How to Use the app
1. Clone or download the project from git
2. Open the index.html in a browser
3. The app shows the neighbourhood that I visit in Cayey, Puerto Rico
4. Click on the markers or the item in the list to show the nama and address of the location
5. The locations can be filtered by typing the location name in the text box
